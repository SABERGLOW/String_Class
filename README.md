# String Class
Home made string class in C++.

# Overview:
In general (and in the C++ programming language in particular), the String class is a standard representation for a string of text. This class removes many of the problems introduced by C-style strings by putting the responsibility of memory management on the String class rather than on the programmer. The class should provide some typical string operations like comparison, concatenation, random access to elements, length, etc.

The aim of the project is to practice dynamic class attributes, constants, const reference parameters, and static class members as well as development of general programming skills in C++.

# Decomposition of the program:
* **String.h file:** class declaration header.
* **StringTest.cpp**: the main program with testing code.
* **String.cpp:**  implementation of class members declared in the header.
